Description
This project is a backend challenge to create a basic rest api that can perform CRUD operations on Users and their Blogs
I designed it for using as simple as posible, so I didn't use hard method to make it complicate to use, now it can only create read update and delete blogposts and give access to author of its blog can be able to modify it. But in the future I will make it better, such as add a token to be able to use easily for user to log in to modify their blogs, another feature I was planning to do is to assign admin user who has all rights to delete user blog that contain violent content
